## File Organization
/Documentation/AN1249.pdf - Microchip documentation for Crosswire code example.
/Examples/ - Projects directory including examples.
/Examples/Multireceive - A Simulink-based project demonstrating reception of multiple messages per timestep. (configured for dspic33fj28MC802)
/Examples/Simulink Echo - A Simulink-based project that echoes any received messages. (configured for dspic33fj28MC802)
/ecan_dspic.mdl - The Simulink library model.
/CircularBuffer.{h,c} - A circular buffer implementation supporting CAN message structs.
/ecanDefinitions.h - A file defining common strucuts, unions, and constants used by other code.
/ecanFunctions.{h,c} - The actual ECAN functions called from the dsPIC blocks.  ECAN message data array size is pound defined here.
